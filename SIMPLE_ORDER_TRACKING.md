# 📊 Simple Order Tracking (Works Now - No Email Setup Needed!)

## ✅ What Works RIGHT NOW

You don't need email to track orders! I've set up a simple system that works immediately.

## 🎯 How to See Your Orders

### Method 1: Admin Dashboard (Easiest)

**Visit**: http://localhost:3002/admin/orders

**You'll see:**
- 📋 All orders in a table
- 👤 Customer information

### Method 2: Check JSON File

**Location**: `data/orders.json`

Open this file to see all orders in JSON format:
```json
[
  {
    "orderNumber": "ORD-1234567890",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "customer": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "555-1234"
    },
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "Custom T-Shirt Printing",
        "quantity": 5,
        "price": 1599
      }
    ],
    "total": 7995,
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```
