## ⚙️ Environment Variables for Vercel

Add these in Vercel project settings:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_test_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-project.vercel.app
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=DBA.alvarado@gmail.com
```

(Get your Stripe key from stripe.com → Developers → API Keys)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations on Vercel

### Cart Persistence:
- **Current**: SQLite database (won't work on Vercel)
- **On Vercel**: Cart saved in browser only
- **Impact**: Cart clears when customer changes devices
- **Solution**: Use Vercel KV or Postgres (can add later)

### Recommendation:
- **Deploy first** with browser-only cart
- **Add database** later if needed
- **Stripe tracks** all orders anyway!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel

**Check Terminal Output for**:
```bash
# Run this locally first:
npm run build
```

If it fails locally, fix errors before deploying.

### Environment Variables Not Working

- Make sure they're added in Vercel Settings
- Check spelling and formatting
- Redeploy after adding variables

### Images Not Showing

- Verify images are in `public/assets/images/`
- Check they're committed to git
- Paths should start with `/` not `./`

## 📞 Support

If you need help:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Read error messages in browser console (F12)
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Test locally first with `npm run dev`
